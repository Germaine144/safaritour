                <strong>Tarangire National Park</strong> is renowned for its enormous elephant herds and iconic baobab trees. During the dry season, 
                the Tarangire River becomes a magnet for wildlife, creating incredible game viewing opportunities with elephants, lions, leopards, 
                and over 500 bird species congregating along the riverbanks.
